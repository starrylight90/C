//Bubble Sort
/*
*	In Bubble sort, Each element of the array is compared with its adjacent element.
	The algorithm processes the list in passes.
	A list with n elements requires n-1 passes for sorting.
	Consider an array A of n elements whose elements are to be sorted by using Bubble sort.
	The algorithm processes like following.
	In Pass 1, A[0] is compared with A[1], A[1] is compared with A[2], A[2] is compared with A[3] and so on.
	At the end of pass 1, the largest element of the list is placed at the highest index of the list.
	In Pass 2, A[0] is compared with A[1], A[1] is compared with A[2] and so on.
	At the end of Pass 2 the second largest element of the list is placed at the second highest index of the list.
	In pass n-1, A[0] is compared with A[1], A[1] is compared with A[2] and so on. At the end of this pass.
	The smallest element of the list is placed at the first index of the list.
